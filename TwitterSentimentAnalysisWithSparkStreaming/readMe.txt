In this project, I have worked with Sparkâ€™s streaming APIs and Python for processing live data streams. Since the streaming data has to be processed in real time, one of the first requirements is to get access to the streaming data; In this case, tweets. To have a consistent dataset, I will be simulating real-time streaming of tweets. In addition, I will also be using Kafka to buffer the tweets before processing. Kafka provides a distributed queuing service which can be used to store the data when the data creation rate is more than processing rate.
