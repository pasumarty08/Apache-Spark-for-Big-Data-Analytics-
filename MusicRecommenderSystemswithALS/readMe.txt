In this project, I created a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify, as it enriches the user experience. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix). 
To create this system, I have used Apache Spark and the collaborative filtering technique.
